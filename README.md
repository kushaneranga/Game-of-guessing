# Game-of-guessing
Uncover the Secret


The game starts with a secret word on the screen. Only one letter of the word is visible. Other letters are shown as dashes. Then the user has to guess a letter and enter it.

If the secret word contains that letter, all the occurrence of the letter is uncovered

Then the user is asked to guess another letter and the same thing happens

The user has 10 attempts to guess.

If the user uncovers the whole word within 10 attempts, he/she wins. Otherwise, he/she loses.
